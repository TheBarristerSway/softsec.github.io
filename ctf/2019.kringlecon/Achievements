MongoDB
From: Holly Evergreen
MongoDB Documentation - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/listDatabases/#dbcmd.listDatabases

Hey! It's me, Holly Evergreen! My teacher has been locked out of the quiz database and can't remember the right solution.
Without access to the answer, none of our quizzes will get graded.
Can we help get back in to find that solution?
I tried lsof -i, but that tool doesn't seem to be installed.
I think there's a tool like ps that'll help too. What are the flags I need?
Either way, you'll need to know a teensy bit of Mongo once you're in.
Pretty please find us the solution to the quiz!

ðŸ—² Elf University Student Research Terminal - Christmas Cheer Laser Project       ðŸ—²
ðŸ—² ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ðŸ—²
ðŸ—² The research department at Elf University is currently working on a top-secret ðŸ—²
ðŸ—² Laser which shoots laser beams of Christmas cheer at a range of hundreds of    ðŸ—²
ðŸ—² miles. The student research team was successfully able to tweak the laser to   ðŸ—²
ðŸ—² JUST the right settings to achieve 5 Mega-Jollies per liter of laser output.   ðŸ—²
ðŸ—² Unfortunately, someone broke into the research terminal, changed the laser     ðŸ—²
ðŸ—² settings through the Web API and left a note behind at /home/callingcard.txt.  ðŸ—²
ðŸ—² Read the calling card and follow the clues to find the correct laser Settings. ðŸ—²
ðŸ—² Apply these correct settings to the laser using it's Web API to achieve laser  ðŸ—²
ðŸ—² output of 5 Mega-Jollies per liter.                                            ðŸ—²

Iptables (smart braces)
From: Kent Tinseltooth
Iptables - https://upcloud.com/community/tutorials/configure-iptables-centos/

1. Set the default policies to DROP for the INPUT, FORWARD, and OUTPUT chains.
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT DROP    (// This is for adding new rule, it doesn't change default policy -> sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -j DROP)

2. Create a rule to ACCEPT all connections that are ESTABLISHED,RELATED on the INPUT and the OUTPUT chains.
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

3. Create a rule to ACCEPT only remote source IP address 172.19.0.225 to access the local SSH server (on port 22).
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 172.19.0.225 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

4. Create a rule to ACCEPT any source IP to the local TCP services on ports 21 and 80.
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 21 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

5. Create a rule to ACCEPT all OUTPUT traffic with a destination TCP port of 80.
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

6. Create a rule applied to the INPUT chain to ACCEPT all traffic from the lo interface.
sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT

From: Pepper Minstix
(Events and Sysmon)

It's me - Pepper Minstix.
Normally I'm jollier, but this Graylog has me a bit mystified.
Have you used Graylog before? It is a log management system based on Elasticsearch, MongoDB, and Scala.
Some Elf U computers were hacked, and I've been tasked with performing incident response.
Can you help me fill out the incident response report using our instance of Graylog?

It's probably helpful if you know a few things about Graylog.
Event IDs and Sysmon are important too. Have you spent time with those?
Don't worry - I'm sure you can figure this all out for me!

Click on the All messages Link to access the Graylog search interface!
Make sure you are searching in all messages!

The Elf U Graylog server has an integrated incident response reporting system. Just mouse-over the box in the lower-right corner.

Hi! I'm Minty Candycane!
I just LOVE this old game!
I found it on a 5 1/4" floppy in the attic.
You should give it a go!
If you get stuck at all, check out this year's talks.
One is about web application penetration testing.
Good luck, and don't get dysentery!

After basic setup, notice that game is cover the distance. And we can manually change distance. I directly changed it to 7900, and remaining covered by game button "Go"

After coming out talked to Minty again
You made it - congrats!
Have you played with the key grinder in my room? Check it out!
It turns out: if you have a good image of a key, you can physically copy it.
Maybe you'll see someone hopping around with a key here on campus.
Sometimes you can find it in the Network tab of the browser console.
Deviant has a great talk on it at this year's Con.
He even has a collection of key bitting templates for common vendors like Kwikset, Schlage, and Yale.
