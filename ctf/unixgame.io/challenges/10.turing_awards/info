The Turing Award
The ACM A. M. Turing Award is an annual prize given by the Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM) to an individual "who has made lasting contributions of a technical
nature to the computing community". The Turing Award is generally recognized as the
highest distinction in computer science and the "Nobel Prize of computing."

Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie received the Turing Award in 1983 "for their
development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation
of the UNIX operating system.".
