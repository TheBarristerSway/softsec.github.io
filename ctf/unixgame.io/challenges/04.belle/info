The Belle Chess Computer
Ken Thompson, co-inventor of UNIX, is also an avid chess player. At Bell Labs, together with colleague Joe Condon he built Belle, a chess computer that was five times winner of the American Computer Chess Championship and that won the third World Computer Chess Championship (WCCC) in 1980.

Chess players have invented a notation called algebraic notation to record and describe moves in a game of chess. It is based on a system of coordinates that uniquely identify each square on the chessboard, as depicted in the figure below:

A unique coordinate is assigned to each square on the board using a letter (a to h, the file) and a number (1 to 8, the rank).

Below is a recording of the chess match between chess computers Belle from Bell Labs and the University of Michigan’s CHAOS at the 1980 WCCC in Linz, Austria (Belle won the game and the tournament in a closely matched competition). Belle played White.

For the purposes of this question, all that is needed to understand this notation is the following:

A game is written as a series of moves as White/Black pairs, preceded by the move number and a period. For example, in the above match the first two moves are written 1.e4 Nf6

Each move of a piece is indicated by the piece's uppercase letter, plus the coordinate of the destination square. For example, Be5 (move a bishop to e5), Nf6 (move a knight to f6). For pawn moves, a letter indicating pawn is not used, only the destination square is given. For example, e4 (move a pawn to e4). Pieces are encoded as K for king, Q for queen, R for rook, B for bishop, and N for knight.

When a piece makes a capture, an x is inserted immediately before the destination square. For example, Bxe5 (bishop captures the piece on e5). When a pawn makes a capture, the file from which the pawn departed is used to identify the pawn. For example, exd5 (pawn on the e-file captures the piece on d5).

The special chess move of “Castling” between the King and a Rook is indicated by the special notations O-O (for kingside castling) and O-O-O (queenside castling).

A move that places the opponent's king in check has the symbol + appended.

Checkmate at the completion of moves is represented by the symbol #.

The notation 1–0 at the completion of moves indicates that White won, 0–1 indicates that Black won, and ½–½ indicates a draw.
