Below is an article on the evolution of Unix, written by Dennis Ritchie:

Ritchie describes in it the early history of Unix, from its origins as an alternative
to the Multics operating system to the rewriting of the kernel in C that took place
in 1973. Besides being a reference historical article, it also contains technical
details of initial Unix design choices on matters such as the file system of processes.
Pipes (a great source of inspiration for these Unix50 challenges) are also discussed
in great detail.

The input file of this challenge contains the text version of that article.
