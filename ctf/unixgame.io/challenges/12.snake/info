The Nokia Snake
The classic arcade game Snake became wildly popular when a variant of the game
was released on Nokia 3300 series phones. In the game, the player steers a snake
towards an apple.

You are given a file with instructions that control how the snake moves on a 2D grid.

The snake follows instructions top to bottom.

There are only three instructions: move forward, turn left and turn right.

Turning left or right changes the orientation of the snake by 90 degrees without
changing its position. Moving forward lets the snake move 1 step forward in the
direction it is facing.

If the snake bumps against the edge of the grid or against a wall, it remains
at its previous position.

Look below to see the starting position of the snake and the target position of
the apple.

The starting list of instructions is:

turn left
