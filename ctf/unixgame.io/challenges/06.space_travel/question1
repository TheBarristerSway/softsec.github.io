You are given a file with two columns: the names of different bodies in the solar
system, and their gravitational pull (in m/s^2).

Can you order the bodies by how easy it would be to land on them in Thompson's Space
Travel game when playing at the highest simulation scale (i.e. fully zoomed out)?

Your solution file should contain just a single column with the names of
planets, in the correct order.
