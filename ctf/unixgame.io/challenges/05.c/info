The C Programming Language
The C programming language was designed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. The UNIX kernel was originally written in assembler, but was later rewritten in C.

You are given the following text file, containing the code of the venerable "hello world" C program. This program prints the words "hello, world":

main()
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
The first person to implement the above program was Brian W. Kernighan, who used it as the very first example of a C program in the C Programming Language book, also known as the "K&R book" or the "C Bible". It has since become tradition to introduce novice programmers to a new programming language through "hello, world" programs.
