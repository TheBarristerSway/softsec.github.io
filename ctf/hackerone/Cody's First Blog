Page structure

    1. Since it say that PHP is used, let's try to get php info
        a. Used below lines, and it gave flag
            <?php
                phpinfo();
            ?>

    2. Check the source of the main page. Shows comment "?page=admin.auth.inc"
        a. Try this page and actually it works
        b. Both the fields "username" and "password" doesn't show SQL injection
        c. None of the fields show XSS injection too
        d. just enter some wild card after "?page=admin.auth.inc/*". This shows
           error that mention use of inlcude() function. Indication is that
           there could be other pages in the same location
        e. Try pages like /app/index, admin, auth, inc, admin.auth, admin.inc, auth.inc etc.
        f. admin.inc shows the flag

    3. Exploring errors during incorrect pages gives idea of page structure.
        a. All the comments entered in home page, and approved at page=admin.inc
           are visible in ?page=http://localhost/index page
        b. Tried few comments e.g.
           <?PHP echo "pawan"); ?>
           <?PHP echo system('ls'); ?>
           <?PHP echo system('cat *'); ?>
        c. Above commands will keep giving information. One of the comment
           gave flag. And at the same time keep checking source of the file.
           That gave another and most coveted flag.

    NOTE: Learning is include() function in PHP and RFI (Remote File Inclusion).
          Also LFI (Local File Inclusion)
