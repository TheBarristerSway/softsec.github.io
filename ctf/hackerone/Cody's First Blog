Page structure

    1. Since it say that PHP is used, let's try to get php info
        a. Used below lines, and it gave flag
            <?php
                phpinfo();
            ?>

    2. Check the source of the main page. Shows comment "?page=admin.auth.inc"
        a. Try this page and actually it works
        b. Both the fields "username" and "password" doesn't show SQL injection
        c. None of the fields show XSS injection too
        d. just enter some wild card after "?page=admin.auth.inc/*". This shows
           error that mention use of inlcude() function. Indication is that
           there could be other pages in the same location
        e. Try pages like /app/index, admin, auth, inc, admin.auth, admin.inc, auth.inc etc.
        f. admin.auth shows the flag
