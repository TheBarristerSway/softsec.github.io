Page structure

    1. Since it say that PHP is used, let's try to get php info
        a. Used below lines, and it gave flag
            <?php
                phpinfo();
            ?>

    2. Check the source of the main page. Shows comment "?page=admin.auth.inc"
        a. Try this page and actually it works
