Page structure
page/1
page/2
page/create
page/edit/<page_num>

	1. Click on Create a new page (http://35.190.155.168/daa1372179/page/create)
		a. This will create new page "page/10"
		b. So, what happened to the pages between 3 to 9?
		c. Try editing all the pages in between e.g. page/edit/3, page/edit/4.......page/edit/9
		d. One of the page is hidden i.e. page/edit/7 and get flag
	NOTE: The important learing is to pay attention when page/7 is accessed. It has shown "Forbidden" as compare to "Not Found"
	for other pages. This is kind of hint that this page is little different than others.
