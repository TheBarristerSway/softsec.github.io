Page structure
page/1
page/2
page/create
page/edit/<page_num>

	1. Click on Create a new page (http://35.190.155.168/daa1372179/page/create)
		a. This will create new page "page/10"
		b. So, what happened to the pages between 3 to 9?
		c. Try editing all the pages in between e.g. page/edit/3, page/edit/4.......page/edit/9
		d. One of the page is hidden i.e. page/edit/7 and get flag
	NOTE: The important learing is to pay attention when page/7 is accessed. It has shown "Forbidden" as compare to "Not Found"
	for other pages. This is kind of hint that this page is little different than others.

	2. This was tough and not so straightforward. I had to take hint for this. The given hint was
	"Bugs often occur when an input should always be one type and turns out to be another".
		a. So based on this try every possible character (alphanumeric, special character etc.) in page/* or page/edit/*
		b. One of the input will be "page/edit/'" and that will give a flag
